<a href="http://www.girlswithslingshots.com/comic/gws-1905/">New comic!</a><br>Today's News:<br><p>No wants to start their first conversation with their estranged father they're talking to for the first time in ten years with the words "pussy whipped."</p>
<p>Speaking of ten years, I didn't notice that today is the official TEN YEAR ANNIVERSARY of GWS until I wrote the date on today's strip!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't have anything special to share for the occasion, really, since I already celebrated the decadeversary over the summer, but I'd like to thank everyone who's been tagging along and reading the strip for the past DECADE! Back when you were wearing MC Hammer pants and playing pogs and listening to Boys II Men. I do not remember what ten years ago was like, but I'm 83% certain that's what was going on back then.&nbsp;Cheers, readers!</p>
<p>Now back to our regularly scheduled awkwardfest.</p>

<a href="http://www.girlswithslingshots.com/comic/gws-1902/">New comic!</a><br>Today's News:<br><p>It seems <a href="http://www.girlswithslingshots.com/comic/gws1531">Hazel is prone to leaving her mother's bathroom in this manner.</a></p>
<p>(Yes, it's the same bathroom, I was just lazy back then and now I have <a href="http://laeluu.com/">Laeluu</a> coloring for me, so!)</p>
<p>In case the goldfish dream seemed familiar, but you couldn't put your finger on why, here's <a href="http://www.girlswithslingshots.com/comic/gws-1483/">a little reminder of Hazel's past fishy dreams</a>. (Apparently she always wakes up to SOMEONE on the pillow next to her.)</p>

<a href="http://www.girlswithslingshots.com/comic/gws-1899/">New comic!</a><br>Today's News:<br><p>This comic goes out to everyone I met on my summer trip who asked me when McPedro was coming back. Your voices have been heard. :)</p>

<a href="http://www.girlswithslingshots.com/comic/gws-1897/">New comic!</a><br>Today's News:<br><p>I wound up killing a lot of time on <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/dcorsetto">Twitter</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/danielle.corsetto">Facebook</a></strong> asking people to share their grammatical pet peeves to use in today's strips. Jesus, that recevied more opinions and reactions than most of my cat videos do! Did you hear me? MORE THAN&nbsp;CAT VIDEOS</p>
<p>Anyway, most people had the common you're/your and they're/there/their gripes, plus some it's/its thrown in here and there. I could spend all day telling you how much <a href="http://homeworktips.about.com/od/improvingyourgrammar/a/onewordortwo.htm"><strong>"everyday" vs. "every day"</strong></a> bugs me even more, or how I think that the made-up word&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/poem-lot">"alot" is a better mistake than TOTALLY misuing the word "allot,"</a></strong> but I'm a full-time cartoonist, not a full-time grammarian, and let's face it, since I <a href="http://www.girlswithslingshots.com/comic/gws-849"><strong>started to be vocal about my grammar pet peeves</strong></a>&nbsp;years ago, I've been humbled (read: embarrassed) by people who know WAY more about grammar than I do over the past few years.</p>
<p>So instead, I'll just casually drop in these wonderful links for you guys to read at your leisure. It's Friday, after all; like your boss is really paying attention to what you're doing at work. Besides, it's good for your language health! I hope you're wearing business casual.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/GrammarGirl">Grammar Girl</a></strong> (aka Mignon Fogarty) will always be my hearthrob. <strong><a href="http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/poem-lot">Here's a little ditty about the word "alot,"</a></strong> which is still not nearly as bad as misusing "allot," in my opinion.</p>
<p>Here's <strong><a href="http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/dos-and-donts">how Grammar Girl feels about do's and don'ts</a></strong>. (For the record, I agree.)</p>
<p>Ever wonder why &nbsp;spell it <strong><a href="http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/whoa-or-woah">"whoa" instead of "woah"</a></strong>?</p>
<p>Or maybe you wondered about the difference between <strong><a href="http://www.writingclasses.com/Products/PubsDetail.php/publicationID/187">yay, yea, and yeah</a></strong>? (Scroll down, search for the words, and hit "Read.")</p>
<p>My earlier snarl regarding the word&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://homeworktips.about.com/od/improvingyourgrammar/a/onewordortwo.htm">"everyday" versus "every day"</a></strong> is explained here, along with other compound words. (I'm a fan of using words like "alright," "altogether," and "already," for the record.) If you serve breakfast every day, like EVERY FUCKIN DAY, use two words. If breakfast is an everyday occurance (in that "everyday" describes the occurance), use it as one word.</p>
<p>An <strong><a href="http://www.grammar-monster.com/glossary/compound_nouns.htm">overview of compound nouns</a></strong> (beware the audio ads, sorry!).</p>
<p>I didn't <strong><a href="https://soundcloud.com/slateradio/lexicon-valley-no-32-the">listen to all of this podcast</a></strong>, but it seems like something us condescending part-time sometimes-wrong grammar nuts should listen to.</p>
<p>And, of course, <a href="http://stephentall.org/2011/09/19/oxford-comma/"><strong>my favorite argument for the Oxford comma, starring JFK and Stalin as strippers</strong>.</a> (Credit: <a href="http://aeferg.com/">AEFERG Illustration</a>.)</p>
<p>For the record, I think <strong>the Oxford comma</strong> should be used the same way we use apostrophes with an s for plural nouns: only when it's necessary to make clear our intentions.</p>
<p>Funny enough, humans created language so that we can all communicate our ideas clearly to one another. So it's okay to be a human and make your own decisions when you use your language, so long as you're being careful to use it in a way that communicates your ideas clearly to others.</p>
<p>That said, I hold the unpopular opinion that if you say <strong>"I could care less"</strong> SARCASTICALLY, knowing that you mean the opposite... it's okay. Just make sure you're very clear in meaning "like, as if I could care less." Say it in a valley girl voice; everyone should get what you mean.</p>
<p>I know I'm gonna get some hate for that.</p>
<p><strong>Y'all </strong>is and will always be an acceptable word in my book, so long as you know where to put the apostrophe. (Y'all is short for "you all." Do not write it "ya'll.")</p>
<p>You can use "y'all" to define one person if you'd like to make them feel really important. Use <strong>"all y'all"</strong> if you're talking to more than four of us.</p>
<p>Intentional misuse of the word <strong>"literally"</strong> is funny to me when used as an obvious hyperbole (Brian Filon, this one's for you). Just make sure you know the difference between "literally" and "figuratively." The former means FOR ACTUAL REAL SERIOUS. The latter means "I'm saying this for <strong><a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/yuk">yuks</a></strong>."</p>
<p>I love <strong>semicolons</strong>; I think you should all learn how to use them. Let them fall between two full, complete sentences that relate well to each other.</p>
<p>And finally, yes, <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2YLNgJ6BtI">this video is dorky</a></strong>, fine, but&nbsp;it doesn't stop me from fully enjoying it. (Thanks, <a href="https://twitter.com/GrammarRumble">@GrammarRumble</a>!)</p>

<a href="http://www.girlswithslingshots.com/comic/gws-1890/">New comic!</a><br>Today's News:<br><p><em>***PSA!***</em></p>
<p>First things first: here's a link to the <strong><a href="http://www.nuvaring.com/">NuvaRing</a></strong>&nbsp;website, which is the mystical "Ring" Jameson &amp; Maureen are&nbsp;talking about. It actually sounds AMAZING (special thanks to Nurse Annie for explaining how it works to me!). You push it in and place it around the opening of your cervix for 3 weeks, take it out for a week to have your period, then put in another one and repeat.</p>
<p>(We'll go into more detail later; I just wanted to give you the basics in case this concept was way beyond you.)</p>
<p><em>***end PSA***</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hey guys! Were you at <strong><a href="http://baltimorecomiccon.com/">Baltimore Comic Con</a></strong> this past weekend? I wasn&rsquo;t!&nbsp;</p>
<div><u><strong>GWS Volume 8!!</strong></u></div>
<div>I was a bit saddened to pass up on Baltimore this year, a local show that I'd attended for nearly a decade (maybe more?) until this past weekend. But I needed the weekend to stay home and work on GWS Volume 8, whic I'll be putting together this week with the help of my intern <strong><a href="http://readysetcreate.tumblr.com/">Nicole</a></strong> - at a slightly accelerated rate - so that it&rsquo;s available in time for Christmas this year (thanks <strong><a href="http://www.topatoco.com/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&amp;Category_Code=GWS">TopatoCo</a></strong>!). So I hope you Baltimore attendees won't hold it against me!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Besides, I'll be at another local show this weekend! That show is...</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u><strong>SPX!!</strong></u></div>
<div>The <strong><a href="http://www.spxpo.com/">Small Press Expo</a></strong> is one of my FAVORITE shows and it's very arts- and independents-focused. It's held right off the White Flint Metro station (Red Line) in Bethesda, MD, and it's only $15 to get in Saturday, or $10 on Sunday. Plus it starts at, like, normal weekend sleep-in hours!</div>
<div><br>
Anyway, I'll be DEAD CENTER&nbsp;against the back wall, right at the end of TopatoCo, at <strong>booth W31</strong>! If I play my cards right, I'll be between three of my favorite humans: <strong><a href="http://www.dieselsweeties.com/">Rich Stevens</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="http://www.tinykittenteeth.com/">Frank</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://beckydreistadt.com/">Becky</a></strong>! Come visit; aforementioned intern Nicole will be there, as will my Vermont intern <strong><a href="http://stephaniezuppo.tumblr.com/">Stephanie</a></strong>&nbsp;and they're both really excellent!</div>
<div><br>
Speaking of interns...</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u><strong>Kickstarter!!</strong></u></div>
<div>Looks like the Vintage Packs and Nude Packs are the next rewards I need to ship out! Nicole and I (and probably some help from Stephanie) will do our best to get those out in a timely manner.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you pledged to my Kickstarter for a fancy reward last June, and are wondering when you&rsquo;ll get that fancy reward, please <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2146920908/the-gws-slingshot-across-america-tour">check the right-hand column here</a> to find the level you pledged and check the &ldquo;estimated delivery&rdquo; date below it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Or you can log in to Kickstarter and check your backer history; the level at which you pledged, AND the reward and its delivery date, will be right there. :)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Speaking of... the Internet... ? ....</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u><strong>Archive Page!!</strong></u></div>
<div>When you <strong><a href="http://www.girlswithslingshots.com/archive.php">click the Archive button below the strip</a></strong>, it'll now bring you directly to a collection of the GWS books and their tables of contents, linked to each strip they refer to, so that you can go directly to the strips you wanna read! Especially useful for those times when you're like "I do NOT remember this character" or you're like "<a href="http://www.girlswithslingshots.com/comic/gws-1222">Did Jameson and Maureen actually talk about having kids already?</a>" (Spoilers: yes.)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Additionally, if you want one of the books (like, physically) (not, like, sexually) (or maybe sexually too I guess), you can just click on the book cover you want and it'll take you STRAIGHT to the <a href="http://www.topatoco.com/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&amp;Category_Code=GWS">GWS section of the TopatoCo store</a>.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Look at how easy I made everything for you.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>(Actually, Erin did, but... details.) (No, seriously though, <strong><a href="http://www.metacarpolis.com/">Erin's the shit.</a></strong>)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Wondering why Volume 5 says "sold out?" Well,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><u><strong>Volume 5 Sold Out!!</strong></u></div>
<div>Volume 5 is sold out! Who knew??*</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So, good/bad news. The bad news is, if you wanted Book 5, it is NOT going to be reprinted, so you'll have to scour the Internet for a used copy (or ask <a href="http://dlair.net/austin/">Dragon's Lair in Austin</a> VERY nicely if they have any left).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The good news is, if you have a copy of Book 5 that you don't mind giving up, you can probably sell it online super easily! Just saying.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This is the first book to sell out that WON'T be reprinted, and <strong><a href="http://www.topatoco.com/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=TO&amp;Product_Code=GWS-BOOK02&amp;Category_Code=GWS">Book 2</a></strong> is on its way out as well. Just a heads-up, guys!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em>*me, TopatoCo, and anyone who came to a signing during my tour, post-midwest</em></div>
